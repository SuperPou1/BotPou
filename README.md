A fun discord bot that has fun commands and you can edit them
# How to install
## On Windows:
1.Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)<br/>
2.Run file "installDependencies.bat" and wait till it finishes, ignore any errors.
## On Linux:
1.Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)<br/>
2.open terminal and navigate to the folder with "installDependencies.sh" and type command "chmod +x installDependencies.sh"<br/>
3.Run file "installDependencies.sh" and wait till it finishes, ignore any errors.<br/>
You can also optionally install [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which I highly recommend for programming this bot.
# How to run
Simply run the file  "run.bat" or "run.sh" or if you're using visual studio code open a new terminal and type "node index.js"
