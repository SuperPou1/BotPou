# BotPou
A fun discord bot that has fun commands and you can edit them
# How to install
1.Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.Run file "installDependencies.bat" and wait till it finishes, ignore any errors.
You can also optionally install [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which I highly recommend for programming this bot.
# How to run
Simply run the file  "run.bat" or if you're using visual studio code open a new terminal and type "node index.js"
